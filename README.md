The Reward Card System is the feature I developed for my 2019 summer internship at Learning A-Z.

Here is the demo: https://laz.huberthung.me  
Mobile Repo: https://github.com/hubert322/reward-card-system-mobile

For this project, I:
- Implemented a new feature that allows teachers to generate reward cards and students to redeem them through QR codes to increase student and teacher interaction with our products even offline using AngularJs, PHP, and MySQL
- Expanded feature onto Android and iOS to reach out to 30,000+ students using Google Mobile Vision API and AVFoundation
- Isolated the feature onto its own server to allow an easy live demo experience with the help of Nginx and Digital Ocean
- Practiced clean code principles such as self-documentation, DRY, single responsibility (separating API controllers, services, database gateways), and layers of abstraction to allow the code to be more readable and scalable
